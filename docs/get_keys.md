# Explanation About Callback

What is important in receiving the keys in each of the services is the **Callback (Redirect)** address. In this regard, you must register the address as below.

```
https://yourBaseUrl.com/oauth/call-back
```

`Shield OAuth` allows you to put another expression in the place of `call-back`, for this you need to make the necessary changes in the `app/Config/ShieldOAuthConfig.php` file.

```php
public string $call_back_route = 'any-name-for-call-back';
```

Be careful that you must provide the same address for all services.

```
https://yourBaseUrl.com/oauth/any-name-for-call-back
```
